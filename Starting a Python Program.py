# The Pseudocode
#   Start the Program
#   in main, generate a random integer that is greater than 5 and less than 13.
#   print this number on its own line.
#   use a loop to append to the list a number of elements equal to the random
#   integer argument. All new list elements must be random integers ranging from 1
#   to 100, inclusive. Duplicates are okay.
#   Return the list to main
#   back in main, catch the returned list and sort it.
#   finally, use a for loop to display the sorted list elements, all on one line,
#   separated by single spaces.
#   End Program
