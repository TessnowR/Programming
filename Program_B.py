#Program B
# The Pseudocode
#   Start the Program
#    In main, create an empty list
#    Open the file named scores.txt
#    use a while loop that can detect the end of file to read the scores and add them
#    to the list
#    close file.
#    call the showscores function with the list of scores as sole argument
#    inside the showscores function"
#        process the list of scores
#        print out the average score accurate to two decimal places
#   End Program
